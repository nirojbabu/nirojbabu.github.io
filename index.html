    <h2>History  </h2>
    <p>G&N Store was established in 1994 by Mr. and Mrs. Ganesh Gautam with a motive of selling fresh fruits and vegetables directly from the farmers to the consumers. Farmers get good price for the products they grow and customers get chance to eat healthy and fresh fruits and vegetables from local farmers. We are not only supporting farmers but also supporting local productions and motivating farmers. We have now grown for 2 people to 30 people in our store. We buy fruits and vegetables from the farmers from all over the country while maintaining safety. We also sell organic fruits and vegetables. We are country's <strong> No. 1 Grocery Store</strong>. We have wide range of products along with dried fruits and vegetables, tea and coffee produced locally.
